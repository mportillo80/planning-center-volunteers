# Planning Center Volunteers

This web application pulls volunteer information from your respective Planning Center church to quickly create a welcome email template that can be distributed via the Planning Center Online website. It also generates an email with latest assignments to a relevant party. This can be shared with any relevant volunteer at your local church that helps with assigning other volunteers!

## Setup

`npm start` - concurrently trigger the front and back-end systems (mongo is setup via Homebrew)

## TODO

- need to flesh out express to get the endpoints cleaned up
- look up good practice for file structure
- test express endpoint: curl -i -X GET http://localhost:4000/leads
